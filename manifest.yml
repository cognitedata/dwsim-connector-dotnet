  description: Integrates the DWSIM simulator with CDF
  documentation: >
    The Cognite DWSIM Connector integrates the DWSIM simulator with CDF. The connector should be configured and installed in the same host machine running the simulator. 
    It reads model files and simulation configurations from CDF, invokes DWSIM to run the simulations, and saves the results back to CDF as time series.
