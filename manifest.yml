  description: Integrates the DWSIM simulator with Cognite Data Fusion
  documentation: >
    The Cognite DWSIM Connector integrates the DWSIM simulator with CDF (Cognite Data Fusion). Once installed at a host machine with access to DWSIM, the connector reads model files and routines defined in CDF simulators API and uses them to run DWSIM simulations on schedule or on demand. The simulation results are saved in CDF as simulation data or, optionally, as time series data points.

versions:
  "1.0.0-alpha-127":
    description: Multiple updates to model library
    changelog:
      changed:  
        - "The `Cognite.Simulator.Utils` version has been updated to open up for future enhancements, e.g. model flowsheet extraction."
  "1.0.0-alpha-126":
    description: Auto-discarding of old simulation runs & config updates
    changelog:
      added:
        - "Introduced `connector.simulation-run-tolerance` configuration option to prevent simulation runs pile-up. The connector will time out simulation runs that are older than this value (in seconds)."
      changed:  
        - "**Breaking** Removed redundant `simulator` configuration section from the configuration file, moved the `data-set-id` configuration property under the `connector` section."
  "1.0.0-alpha-125":
    description: Support for bigger model files
    changelog:
      added:
        - "Bumped the theoretical limit for the supported size of the model files. (up until 8GB)"
  "1.0.0-alpha-124":
    description: Refactored the routine runner
    changelog:
      changed:
        - "Refactored the routine runner, making it more similar to other connectors."

  "1.0.0-alpha-122":
    description: Scalability improvements
    changelog:
      fixed:
        - "Improve the scalability of the connector by sending fewer requests to the routine revision list endpoint."
  "1.0.0-alpha-121":
    description: Multiple improvements
    changelog:
      added:
        - "**Breaking** deleted model-library.state-store-interval configuration option. Use model-library.library-update-interval instead."
        - "Added more debug logs on simulation routine base methods."
        - "Increased default refresh interval for the model library and routine library to 10 seconds."
        - "Increased the default timeout for the soft restart of the connector to 10 seconds after the failure."
      fixed:
        - "Fixed the issue where error during startup was being swallowed and connector would not be re-started after."
  "1.0.0-alpha-120":
    description: Minor improvements
    changelog:
      added:
        - "Allow minimum log level override per simulation run."
        - "Adopt new features on the routine list endpoint."
